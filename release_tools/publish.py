    This script will generate a new release in the repository.

    To run it, you will need to provide the version number and
    the author of the new release.

    By default the command does not push the commit release to a
    remote repository. To force it, use the parameter `--push`
    including the name of the remote where commits will be pushed.

    To do so, set '--only-push' together with '--push' option.
