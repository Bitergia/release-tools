title: Push release only with `publish`

  The command `publish` generates the commit and tag
  release but by default it does not push them to a
  remote repository. The idea behind this is to review
  the changes before pushing them. After the review,
  to upload the new changes, it will necessary to call
  directly to `git push` because `publish` will try to
  create the same release data again.

  To fix this problem a the new flag `--only-push` is
  available. When it is called together with `--push`,
  the command will ignore the creation of the release
  pushing to the origin the latest changes.
