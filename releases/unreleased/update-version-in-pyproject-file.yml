title: Automate version updates in pyproject file

 Besides the file `_version.py`, there is another file
 that stores the version number of the package. This file is
 `pyproject.toml` and is used by `poetry` to generate Python
 packages and source code tarballs. The command `semverup`
 will also update this version number when called.

 This file will also be part of the release commit generated
 by `publish` command.
