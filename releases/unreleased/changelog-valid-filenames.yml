title: Changelog valid filenames
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
    Creating filename from the title could create invalid
    paths. This commits change the way the filename is 
    created from the title removing many of the special chars.
