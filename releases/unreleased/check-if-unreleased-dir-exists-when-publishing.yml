title: Check if unreleased dir exists when publishing
category: fixed
author: Santiago Due√±as <sduenas@bitergia.com>
issue: 5
notes: >
  An exception was raised when `publish` command was called
  and `unreleased` directory did not exist. Now, instead of
  raising an exception, `publish` command fails and displays
  a message with the error.
