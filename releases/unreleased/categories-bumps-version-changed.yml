    Previously, only the `fixed` notes incremented the `patch` version, and the other changes
    incremented MINOR. We updated this behavior.

    From now on, `changed` and `removed` entries increment major version.
    `added`, `deprecated`, `security`, `performance` and `other` increment
    the minor version. `Fixed` and `dependency` increment the patch version.

    If the version is 0.x.x new entries will upgrade minor version at most.
