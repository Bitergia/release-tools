title: Recover from the inconsistent state after publish fails
category: added
author: Venu Vardhan Reddy Tekula <venu@bitergia.com>

notes: >
    When publish fails, the command leaves the git repository
    in an inconsistent state. The author needs to check the 
    status of the repository manually and then fix everything 
    back to normal.
    
    This feature checks for any possible errors; if it finds 
    any, it informs about them to the user and rollbacks the 
    operations before it exists.
