title: Invalid release candidate version number when adding new changes
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: |
  `semverup` was not increasing the correct version number
  when the old version was a release candidate and a new
  changelog was included. Before it increased `0.0.5-rc.1`
  to `0.0.5-rc.2` when a minor changelog entry was added
  while it should be `0.1.0-rc.1`.
