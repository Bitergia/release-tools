title: Replace pull request field for issue in changelog entries
category: changed
author: Santiago Due√±as <sduenas@bitergia.com>
issue: 10
notes: >
  The initial idea of the pull request field in a changelog
  entry was to know which PR introduced the change. The problem
  is the reference is unknown until the PR is generated, so
  developers will need to modify the entry and the PR later
  to include the reference. Therefore, we considered it is
  better to include a reference to an issue which is more
  generic and can be known in advance.
  
  Take into account you will need to update your unreleased
  changelog entries if you want to use this new version of
  the tools.
