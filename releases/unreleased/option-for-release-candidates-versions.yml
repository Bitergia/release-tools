    Include a new argument to `semverup` to create pre-releases versions.
    
    If the option `--pre-release` is included and the current version
    is not a release candidate, it will create a new pre-release version
    based on files or `--bump-version` argument. If the current version
    is a release candidate, it will increase its pre-release part. For
    example, in a repository with a bugfix changelog entry:
      - `0.2.0` + `semverup --pre-release` = `0.2.1-rc.1`
      - `0.2.1-rc.1` + `semverup --pre-release` = `0.2.1-rc.2`
    
    When the version is a pre-release, and `--pre-release` is not specified,
    it will remove the pre-release part and generate the final version. In a
    repository with changelog entries:
      -  `0.2.2-rc.1` + `semverup` = `0.2.2`
