title: Validate content before saving with the changelog tool

notes: >
    When the editor opens with changelog, the user can make
    mistakes and produce an invalid entry file. This would
    break the workflow and produce error while doing semverup.

    This feature validates the format of the yml file and gives
    info about the errors, if any. This gives an option to edit the
    file incase it if has any mistakes, so you need not create a
    new entry.
