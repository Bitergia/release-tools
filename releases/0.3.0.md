## Release Tools 0.3.0 - (2021-04-06)

**New features:**

 * Validate content before saving with the changelog tool (#17)\
   When the editor opens with changelog, the user can make mistakes and
   produce an invalid entry file. This would break the workflow and
   produce error while doing semverup. This feature validates the format
   of the yml file and gives info about the errors, if any. This gives an
   option to edit the file incase it if has any mistakes, so you need not
   create a new entry.
 * Recover from the inconsistent state after publish fails (#18)\
   When publish fails, the command leaves the git repository in an
   inconsistent state. The author needs to check the  status of the
   repository manually and then fix everything  back to normal. This
   feature checks for any possible errors; if it finds  any, it informs
   about them to the user and rollbacks the  operations before it exists.
 * Add option to update AUTHORS file content\
   The AUTHORS file has to updated periodically with the names of the
   contributors. This has to be done manually. This feature adds the
   option `--authors` which allows to update the AUTHORS file with the
   names extracted from the unreleased changelog entries.
