## Release Tools 0.4.0 - (2022-06-02)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix crash running the tools on git submodules (#44)\
   Release tools didn't work when the project is under a git submodule.
 * Notes command removes last author (#46)\
   notes command was removing the last author from the `AUTHORS` file
   when the file did not end with a blank line.

**Feature removals:**

 * Drop Python 3.6 support\
   Python 3.6 reached the end of life at the end of 2021. This means it
   won't receive new updates or patches to fix security issues.
   Therefore, this package will only work with Python >= 3.7 from now on.
